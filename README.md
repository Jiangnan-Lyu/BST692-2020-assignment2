# Assignment 2

For the final project in this class you will be building a website that models which women will present with late stage breast cancer.  That site will have many "tabs" that show different things.  For example, there will be a tab that describes the data, another tab will have a logistic regression model, another will have a summary of a kNN analysis, another will show a CART model, etc.  This assignment asks you to build the content that will go into the descriptive page.  

You will be working gently modified REAL data from a live project run by an surgical oncologist, [Dr. Goel](https://doctors.umiamihealth.org/provider/Neha+Goel/764301), who is collaborating with Ray and Layla.  For this assignment, you can collaborate with others in the class (and your instructors and Dr. Goel).  Keep in mind that you will be able to show this work to potential employers and because this is on GitHub they will be able see what **you** (vs. your collaborators) did and when you did the work.  Do not procrastinate.... it will look bad if they see all your commits piling up in the 3 hours before the steps were due.

Throughout all the assignments you will see instructions like "Modify the .gitingore file to include a data directory".  That means do that step, save, stage, commit and push the file.

## Tasks
